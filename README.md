Welcome settlers to NFTPioneers!

NFTPioneers is a virtual simulator game that gives the experience of real world NFT trading

Objective: To earn $5000 in the least days possible

Instructions:

The player starts with $1000 and each day decides to purchase a variety of NFTs. NFT's come in three different rarities, Common, Epic, and Legendary. There are less Epic and Legendary NFTs and are more expensive than Commons. The rarer the NFT the bigger the price increase but watch out! They can also drop in price for the same amount! Higher risk higher reward just like in real life. Each day the prices of NFTs change, once you reach a total of $5000 in assests you win the game!

Good luck and happy trading our fellow pioneers!
